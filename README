Teethpack
Packer for the Master Levels for Doom II 

Teethpack combines all the data for the Master Levels for Doom II into a single WAD file compatible with all source ports that support UMAPINFO (https://doomwiki.org/wiki/UMAPINFO). The levels are arranged in the Doom Classic Complete order.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

1. Obtain or compile a release archive of Teethpack, then extract it to a new directory.
2. Copy the DOOM2.WAD IWAD and all of the Master Levels PWADs into the "drophere" directory. After doing so, it should contain the following files, provided by you:
    ATTACK.WAD
    BLACKTWR.WAD
    BLOODSEA.WAD
    CANYON.WAD
    CATWALK.WAD
    COMBINE.WAD
    DOOM2.WAD
    FISTULA.WAD
    GARRISON.WAD
    GERYON.WAD
    MANOR.WAD
    MEPHISTO.WAD
    MINOS.WAD
    NESSUS.WAD
    PARADOX.WAD
    SUBSPACE.WAD
    SUBTERRA.WAD
    TEETH.WAD
    TTRAP.WAD
    VESPERAS.WAD
    VIRGIL.WAD
3. Run teethpack.bat (on Windows) or teethpack.sh (on Linux). If you've done everything correctly, UMASTER.WAD will appear in the "output" directory.
4. Load UMASTER.WAD as a PWAD in your (UMAPINFO-compatible) sourceport of choice to play.
5. (optional, but recommended) The Master Levels for Doom II 25th Anniversary MIDI Pack is compatible with the PWAD produced by this program. Simply load ml_midipack_crispydoom.wad alongside UMASTER.WAD.
